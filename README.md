Brain and Cognitive Science Club – AI/ML Task
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook developed as part of a task for the Brain and Cognitive Science Club at IIT Kanpur. The notebook demonstrates foundational applications of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aligned with my growing interest and coursework in AI.

📘 Overview
The notebook covers a full ML pipeline and also includes basic NLP feature engineering:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding, feature scaling, etc.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions and correlations.

Model Training: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.

Performance Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.

NLP Components:

Custom tokenization and lemmatization

Implementation of TF-IDF vectorization from scratch, using Python

🛠️ Dependencies
Make sure the following libraries are installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn nltk
Also, download the necessary NLTK resources (if not already installed):

python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Sujal7508/bcs_Task.git
Navigate to the directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd bcs_Task
Open the notebook:

bash
Copy
